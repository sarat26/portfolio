Hi! I'm **Sara Tatke**, a passionate student at UCLA studying Cognitive Science + Stats/Data Science, inspired by people and challenges. 

My interests are in crypto/fintech, philosophy of the mind, and innovation. I aim to bridge these interests to build real solutions that drive real impact. 



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
